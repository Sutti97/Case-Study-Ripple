# Case-Study-Ripple

## Overview and Origin

* The name of the company that I will be diving into in this Case study is called Ripple.

* It all started in 2011 when three developers named; David Schwartz, Jed McCaleb and Arthur Britto were fascinated with Bitcoin but wanted to create a better system for sending value in a more efficient manner. After hard work they first launched in June 2012 where they were later joined by Chris Larsen and the group started the Company OpenCoin in September 2012. By 2013 they decided to rebrand and changed their name to what we know today as Ripple. 

* The primary source of funding Ripple has been sales of the XRP cryptocurrency. The founders of the XRP Ledger gifted 80 billion of its digital currency known as “XRP” to the company.

## Business Activites

* Ripple's goal is to create a digital asset that was more environmentally friendly, sustainable, and made specifically for payments.  In 2011 and early 2012, the three developers started a project to build a distributed ledger that was based on the improvements of Bitcoins limitations. They wrote code, that when executed, would create a distributed ledger, which they named Ripple. It included a digital asset (digital currency) that would is known as “XRP” . The purpose of XRP was to act as an intermediary between the exchange of currencies or networks. By June 2012, XRP Ledger was fully functioning.  

* XRP transactions are faster (seconds compared to Bitcoin which takes up to an hour) and more reliable than many of its competitors. XRP consumes far less amounts of energy and the processing fee is cheaper compared to the leader in the industry; Bitcoin. Ripple also has a far larger supply of digital currency compared to Bitcoin. (100 billion compared to 21 million) 

* Ripple’s customers include a wide variety of users, but the majority would be Banks/other financial institutions and large international companies that need an effective way of transferring money around even keeping different currencies in mind.  

* The XRP Ledger uses Ledgers and Servers as a form of technology where the Ripple network is managed by a range of independent servers comparing their transaction records constantly and a new ledger of Ripple is created each second.   American Express and Santander have recently partnered with Ripple to speed up cross-border payments between the U.S. and the U.K. technology through Ripple’s enterprise blockchain network, RippleNet (decentralized network using XRP’s ledger and the XRP cryptocurrency).

## Landscape

* The domain in which Ripple is part of is Blockchain and Cryptocurrencies. 

* Cryptocurrency has only recently become a global phenomenon and there is still a lot of unknown potential of it since its constantly evolving. There are many concerns and worries swirling around the technology and its capacity to disrupt traditional financial systems. A current and relevant trend is the use of Blockchain technology used to track vaccines from the point of manufacture to the patient. it can be used to record of where each individual dose was at any given time. Another trend that has been noticed over the last couple of years is investment in blockchain technology by businesses in a variety of different industries from pharmaceuticals to finance to even diamond mining. The investment in blockchain technology is said to reach almost $16 billion USD by 2023 where in 2019 it was only at $2.7 billion USD. Another more recent innovation related that stems from Blockchain technology is the recent rise of NFT’s (Non-fungible Token). NFT’s are one of a kind and irreplaceable digital assets that live on a blockchain and have changed the way people collect and buy items like art, trading cards, etc. 

* Competitors in the blockchain and cryptocurrency domain include the leader in the industry; Bitcoin, and others like Litecoin, Ethereum, IBM, Tangle, Stellar, Blockstream, Nano, OmiseGo and countless others. 

## Results

* The impact that Ripple has had on in this market is its goal to wanting to improve on the limitations of  Bitcoin and companies like Stellar following in Ripples philosophy. 

* Key metrics to compare in this domain include supply, transaction speed/efficiency, transaction cost and energy consumption.

* The supply of digital currency that was mentioned earlier is $100 billion. The transaction speed is 3-5 seconds and complete 1500 transactions per second. The transaction cost of 1 XRP is $0.29. Ripple has only used 474,000 kWh of energy while Bitcoin has used 57.09 Billion kWh of energy. Like I mentioned throughout this case study Ripple is better in all of these key metrics compared to that of Bitcoin. The direct competitor in terms of offering same product/service would be Stellar but are not really comparable in terms of results since Stellar is a non-for profit company while Ripple is a for-profit company. 

## Recommendations

* Ripple is used for mainly for payments via transfer of money on a global scale while can be used for everything including individual payments of simple goods and services. Ripple could find a way to get into the same market as Bitcoin but would be difficult since it would have to involve using Blockchain technology instead a variant of blockchain technology known as a consensus ledger.  A way that Ripple could transfer from a larger/global into a more induvial/peer-to peer niche is to look at what the direct competitor “Stellar”. The only  difference between Ripple and Stellar is that Stellar is a non-for-profit. So since they both use the same technology it would be a seemless transition for Ripple into having individuals as customers whiile still being profitable.

* Expanding Ripple’s niche would benefit the company since it would allow a variety of more customers to use Ripple and would result in more profit over time since adapting the technology might be costly at first. 

* It would not be difficuly to develop the "technology" that I recommended above  since both Ripple and Stellar rely on distributed ledger technology.
